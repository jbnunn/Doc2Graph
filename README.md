# Doc2Graph

Builds a graph based off of content. For example, a sentence like

> Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria -- and wife Sophie Chotek -- were assassinated on June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo. This set off a chain reaction of events that resulted in the outbreak of the first World War.

Should build a graph like: 

    (TBD)

We should be able to query the graph to answer questions like

> Where was Franz Ferdiand from?
> When did Sophie Chotek die?
> What led to World War I?


## TBD

Use word vectors to enhance the graph
